                        <li>Spring onions - 2 stalks</li>
                        <li>Light soy sauce - 2 tsp</li>
                        <li>Dark soy sauce - 1 tsp</li>
                        <li>Sesame oil - half tsp</li>
                        <li>Sugar - quarter tsp</li>
                        <li>White pepper - quarter tsp</li>
                        <li>Rice wine - half tbsp</li>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <div class="Method"
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring 2 litres of water to a boil. Rinse the bean sprouts in cold water and drain. Julienne the scallions. Mix the soy sauces, sesame oil, salt, sugar, wine and white pepper in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Boil the noodles. Fresh noodles should be boiled for about 1 minute. For dried noodles, boil for 2 minutes. Rinse in cold water and drain very well.</li>
                        <li>Heat the wok over high heat and add a tablespoon of oil to coat the wok (you can also use a cast iron or non-stick pan for this). Spread the noodles in a thin, even layer on the wok and tilt the wok in a circular motion to distribute the oil and crisp the bottom layer of the noodles evenly. It should take about 5 minutes for the first side.</li>
                        <li>Flip the noodles over. add another tablespoon of oil around the perimeter of the wok, and let the other side crisp up. Don’t stress if you can’t turn the noodles over in one shot. The goal here is just to get an even crispness and to dry out the noodles during this cooking stage. Set the noodles aside on a plate.</li>
                        <li>Heat the wok over high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil and all of the white parts of the scallion to the pan. Cook for about 15 seconds. Next, add the noodles to the wok and toss them well, breaking up the noodles so they’re not all in one big clump. Add the soy sauce mixture and toss continuously for a couple minutes. Keep the heat on high.</li>
                        <li>After the noodles are uniformly golden brown, add the bean sprouts and toss. Add the rest of the scallions and toss the mixture again for another 1 to 2 minutes until you see the bean sprouts just starting to turn transparent. You want the sprouts to be cooked but still crunchy.</li>
                        <li>Plate and serve!</li>
